financial chat bot

The "Personal Finance Chatbot" project aims to develop an intelligent conversational AI system that leverages IBM's generative AI models and Watson services to provide personalized financial guidance. This initiative will harness advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities within the IBM ecosystem to answer user questions about savings, taxes, and investments, offer generated budget summaries, and suggest actionable spending insights. A core innovation will be the chatbot's ability to adapt its tone and complexity through IBM's AI to suit different user demographics, specifically distinguishing between students and professionals. By providing accessible, tailored financial information and analysis powered by IBM's cutting-edge AI, this project seeks to empower individuals to make more informed financial decisions and improve their overall financial literacy and well-being.
